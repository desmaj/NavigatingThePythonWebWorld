	  This is an API and a protocol used to allow interaction between
	  the different components in a Python web stack. In the beginning,
	  every web project had to have their own server and application
	  specification. So Zope had the Zope server that only worked with
	  Zope and CherryPy had a server that only worked with CherryPy.
	  Nothing was reusable and everyone had to implement everything
	  for their own project.
	  WSGI allows a compliant server to host arbitrary compliant
	  applications. This is a very powerful idea. And totally copied from
	  the Java world.

	  Twisted lets you write callback-based concurrent networked code that
	  is performant. Twisted has its own lingo that you have to learn to use
	  it, but it can be very, very powerful. You just have to be very
	  careful to use the Twisted-provided libraries for all blocking code.
	  If you block in Twisted, you're blocking the whole process.
	  Note: Twisted runs on something called a reactor, and it's basically
	  a scheduler. So it tells Python what to run when. It's important to
	  only do short-lived tasks in Twisted so that you don't block the
	  reactor.
	  Also note: Twisted is built on Deferreds; these are like promises to do
	  something in the future. I, personally, might not be smart enough to
	  use Twisted effectively. YMMV.

	  Python has become a goto language for both rapid web development and
	  also large systems, and the technologies I talked about tonight are
	  some of the tools people are using to write web code. I only touched
	  on things tonight; it might be worth having more in-depth sessions
	  about these topics in the future.
	  There's a common trait shared by all of the technologies that I've
	  talked about: they all have great communities. They have mailing lists
	  and IRC channels and good documentation and people that are there to
	  help.
